- Datacenter Network
  - 3-tier arch to 2-tier arch(Spine-Leaf)
  - For Inter-server traffic
  - Normal Server (10G Base-T Ethernet Port) <--> TOR switch
  - TOR switch <--> Spine Switch (40G, 100G)
- Protocol
  - Once upon a time, Limited resource for communication
  - TCP/IP is not a protocol, but a protocol stack (TCP is a protocol, UDP is a protocol)
  - TCP/IP Model (4 layer)
    - Application - Transport - Internet - Network Access
  - Term : PDU(Protocol Data Unit)
- OSI 7
  - Physical : Accurately send signal
    - Hub, Repeater : Connect devices
    - Cable, Connector : Cable
    - Tranceiver : Connect computer's lan card with cable
    - TAP : Replicate electronic signal to other machine for monitoring network and analyzing packets
  - Data Link : Check addresses and process/validate data
    - Flow Control
      - Sender : Hey, receiver! Can you get data now?
      - with "Pause" Frame 
    - NIC(Network Interface Card) & Switch with MAC
      - NIC : Check MAC
      - Switch : Port filtering & forwarding
  - Network (IP)
    - Router : Find the path for packet
  - Transport
    - Correct packet sequence and loss
    - Send sequence : Seq number
    - Receive sequence : ACK number
    - LB & Firewall
  - Session
    - Help establishing connection and maintaining for edge application

  - Application
    - HTTP, FTP, SMTP
- Encapsulation & Decapsulation
  - Add 3 Headers on Data Flow Layer
  - Decapsulation side : What upper protocol should I use to send?
    - with Protocol number, Port number, Ether type
- Term
  - MSS : Maximum Segment Size (Layer 4, 1460 bytes)
  - MTU : Maximum Transmission Unit (Layer 2, 1500 bytes, 20 for IP header, 20 for TCP header)
